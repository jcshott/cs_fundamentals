### Exercise:
Practice memory management concepts:
 - Passing variables by reference rather than value.
 - Using heap with `malloc()`
 - Using call stack/local variables

 ****
Write a series of programs which takes two numbers and runs a
calculation on them.

The `main` function should call another function to do the calculation, and should pass in the arguments by pointer (reference, not value).  
- add
- subtract
- multiply
- divide
